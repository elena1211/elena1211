## 👩‍💻 About Me  

I’m a career switcher transitioning from event management into software engineering. With 5+ years of experience leading high-impact events, cross-functional coordination, and digital campaigns, I bring strong communication, organisation, and delivery skills into technical environments.

Currently pursuing an **MSc in Computer Science** at **Queen Mary University of London**, I'm focused on full-stack web development, UI/UX logic, and productivity-driven applications.

💡 I love building meaningful tools — from gamified productivity systems to job trackers — that solve real-world problems and spark user engagement.

## 🚀 Final Project (In Progress): [Gamified Productivity App](https://levelup-jet.vercel.app/home)

A web-based system that combines adaptive task scheduling with RPG-style gamification to help users achieve personal goals while building self-discipline.

- 🎯 Adaptive milestone scheduling & difficulty balancing
- 📈 Visual stats panel and XP-driven level system
- 🎮 Missions, character attributes, and reward loops
- 🧠 Built with Django, React, PostgreSQL, Tailwind

> See [project summary](https://github.com/elena1211/gamified_app) | Demo coming soon
